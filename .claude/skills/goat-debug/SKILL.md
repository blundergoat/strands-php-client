## Shared Conventions

Read `.goat-flow/skill-docs/skill-preamble.md` for shared conventions.
On full-depth, also read `.goat-flow/skill-docs/skill-conventions.md`.

## When to Use

Use when diagnosing a bug or understanding unfamiliar code. For onboarding, use investigate mode.
- Bug/symptom --> **Diagnose mode**. Exploring, no bug --> **Investigate mode**.

**If you want to "just try something" before tracing the code path, STOP.** That is the failure mode this skill exists to prevent.

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "The user already diagnosed it, hypotheses are ceremony" | A confidently stated cause is data, not diagnosis. Trace it or eliminate it before acting. |
| "Prod is on fire, D1 is a luxury" | Untraced fixes at 2am are how you get a 3-fix abort at 4am. D1 is the shortest path to a working fix. |
| "Type/config mismatch is a really clean story" | Clean stories that don't mechanically match the symptom (e.g. value-dependent failure from a value-blind cause) are wrong stories. |
| "The specific number in the bug report is probably just phrasing" | Treat every specific number, threshold, or boundary in a bug report as a clue, not rhetoric. |
| "Reading the footgun during an incident looks like second-guessing" | Reading the footgun IS doing your job. Not reading it is what looks bad at post-mortem. |
| "Adding the field is zero-risk - worst case we try the next thing" | This is how you enter the 3-fix abort loop. Hypothesis before code, always. |

## Boundary Commands

- **NEVER:** Turn diagnosis into review, test planning, milestone planning, or an ungated fix.
- **ALWAYS:** Trace the live path, test competing hypothesis categories, and state the reproduction and evidence limits.
- **DEFER TO:** `/goat-review` for quality, `/goat-qa` for test plans, `/goat-plan` for milestones, and the dispatcher for feature briefs.

## Step 0 - Choose Depth

If depth is pre-decided, proceed. Otherwise choose:
- **Quick** when the symptom is isolated to 1-2 files, the user wants diagnosis only, or the prompt already includes a reproduction/error output.
- **Full** when the symptom crosses components, has no reproduction yet, affects CI/prod/user-visible behaviour, or a fix may follow. If uncertain, choose full.
If vague, ask about: goal, symptom/error message, area involved.

**Quick path (D1 + applicable D1.5 + D2):** diagnose and report; minimum evidence is primary file read, 2 hypothesis categories tested, reproduction attempted or no-repro gap stated. Before D2, run D1.5 or state `reproduction already minimal`, `reduction not applicable`, or `unsafe to reduce` with the literal input/command and reason. Quick never enters D3 or D4 directly.

**Full is gated, not linear:** run D1 through D2, then stop, investigate deeper, or request a fix plan. Full diagnosis-only may stop at D2. If a Quick diagnosis leads to a fix request, promote to Full at the D2 gate; do not skip either approval. D3 planning follows the first approval; implementation requires the separate D3 approval; D4 follows implementation only.
**Footgun check:** Use the preamble's learning-loop retrieval on `.goat-flow/learning-loop/footguns/` and `.goat-flow/learning-loop/lessons/` for the target area. Surface matches or an explicit retrieval miss; do not broad-load either bucket.

**Browser evidence detection:** For a URL, local page, screenshot, rendering issue, or browser console/network symptom, read `.goat-flow/skill-docs/playbooks/browser-use.md` and follow its availability, installation-approval, and manual-fallback contract. The playbook is the sole owner of browser installation policy.

Read `references/diagnostic-techniques.md` only when a diagnosis needs mutation classification, causal-distinction detail, or the worked output example.

## Diagnose Mode

### D1 - Investigate (no fixes)

After reading the primary file, declare a scope snapshot: symptom boundary (what is failing), affected components (files/modules/services involved), read estimate, and decision-relevant source/runtime/configuration state. Record material drift without persisting secrets or raw sensitive values.

Write 2-3 hypotheses spanning at least 2 of: Data, Logic, Timing, Environment, Configuration. If the bug involves loops, indices, or pagination, include a boundary/counting hypothesis. After tracing, mark each: CONFIRMED / ADJUSTED / ELIMINATED / UNRESOLVED with `file + semantic anchor` evidence.

**Multi-component failures** (CI → build → deploy, request → middleware → handler → DB, etc.): inspect existing evidence boundary by boundary. Record input, output, and the broken invariant, then investigate the failing component. If new instrumentation is needed, apply the diagnostic-experiment authority below before modifying anything.

**UI-visible bugs:** After writing hypotheses, use browser evidence to confirm or eliminate UI-related hypotheses. Follow the workflow in `.goat-flow/skill-docs/playbooks/browser-use.md`. Browser output is OBSERVED; interpretations remain INFERRED until mapped to `file + semantic anchor`.

**Diagnostic-experiment authority:** Read-only observation may proceed within repository rules. Any experiment affecting source, configuration, local state, network, production, or sensitive data follows the repository's stricter approval boundary. Before a mutation, state the target, expected signal, affected state, rollback, and a cleanup marker; then wait for explicit current-session approval. Track approved mutations separately from the proposed fix. Incomplete cleanup blocks a fixed claim, and user-owned diagnostics are never removed without permission.

If repeated reads or experiments produce no new decision signal, checkpoint: state what was checked, which hypotheses remain, and the next distinguishing evidence needed.

### D1.5 - Minimise

**Goal:** Reduce the failing case without removing the property required for the symptom.

**Procedure:**
1. Identify variables in the reproduction (input data, config, environment, sequence of actions)
2. Choose a method that fits the failure shape; use `references/diagnostic-techniques.md` when simple deletion is unsafe or misleading
3. Preserve the load-bearing order, interaction, workload, environment, or timing condition while reducing unrelated factors

**Output:** Reduced case and method, or a supported minimal/not-applicable/unsafe disposition; literal command/input/steps; tested removals; updated hypothesis set. A removed factor is irrelevant only under the same decision-relevant context.

**Optional bisect path (state-mutating):** Bisect is never required for a reporting-only diagnosis. In reporting-only or no-write mode, describe the option but do not run it. Otherwise require a clean worktree, validate known-good and known-bad refs plus a deterministic, non-destructive predicate at both endpoints, disclose the commands and rollback, then wait for explicit current-session approval. Urgency, an outage, or broad permission to diagnose does not override these gates. A dirty worktree stops this path; an isolated worktree is a separately approved option, not an automatic workaround. After approval, run only the diagnostic predicate. Run `git bisect reset` on success, error, cancellation, or interruption; on resumption, reset before any other repository work.

**Hypothesis ranking:** After minimisation, rank surviving hypotheses by cost and likelihood:

| Likelihood \ Cost | LOW cost | MEDIUM cost | HIGH cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HIGH** likelihood | 1st | 2nd | 3rd |
| **MEDIUM** likelihood | 2nd | 3rd | 4th |
| **LOW** likelihood | 3rd | 4th | Skip |

Test cheap-and-likely first. Skip expensive-and-unlikely until cheap options are eliminated.

### D2 - Diagnosis

Present: root cause + confidence + hypothesis table + reproduction steps. **Confidence floor:** All LOW --> return to D1 or present partial findings.

Symptom reproduction is not root-cause proof. HIGH requires a traced mechanism plus a distinguishing counterfactual or intervention, or deterministic proof that entails the symptom. MEDIUM means the mechanism is traced but distinguishing proof is unavailable or unsafe; name the missing proof. LOW is plausible but has a load-bearing inferred link. Keep root-cause confidence separate from the preamble's proof class.

**Root cause validation before claiming HIGH confidence.** For each candidate root cause, run a causation / necessity / sufficiency check:
- **Causation** - does the proposed cause mechanically produce the observed symptom? Trace the path with `file + semantic anchor`.
- **Necessity** - without this cause, does the symptom still occur? If yes, the cause is insufficient or incomplete.
- **Sufficiency** - is this cause alone enough, or are there co-factors? Name them.

For high-stakes diagnoses, run a 5-Whys chain. Every "because" MUST cite `file + semantic anchor` or a reproduction step, not just prose.

**BLOCKING GATE:** Present diagnosis, then pause. Human decides: dig deeper, propose fix, or stop. If confidence is MEDIUM or LOW with multiple competing hypotheses, consider `/goat-critique` on the hypothesis set before choosing a fix direction.

### D3 - Fix Plan (only if human approved)

Approval to write D3 authorizes planning only, not implementation. State what changes (files + functions), blast radius, architecture check (`.goat-flow/architecture.md`), diagnostic cleanup, rollback, and verification method.

**BLOCKING GATE:** Present the fix plan, then pause. Implement only after explicit approval.

### D4 - Post-Fix Verification (only after approved implementation)
Rerun the **original, unminimized reproduction** from D2 - a code change is not a fix until the symptom is gone under the case that first showed it, since a minimised case proves less. Then run D3 verification, check adjacent regressions, and grep for old patterns after renames. Do not close while any approved diagnostic mutation from D1 remains uncleaned: confirm each cleanup marker, and leave user-owned diagnostics in place.

**3-fix abort rule:** If three independent fixes have failed to resolve the symptom, STOP and reconsider whether the architecture or the root-cause hypothesis is wrong. Do not attempt a fourth patch without first re-entering D1 with a fresh hypothesis set.

**UI bugs:** Rerun the original browser reproduction post-fix. Capture screenshot/state showing the symptom is gone. Follow `.goat-flow/skill-docs/playbooks/browser-use.md`.

**Proof Gate:** Apply the Proof Gate from `skill-preamble.md` to the "fixed" claim - rerun the original repro, cite the literal output, and downgrade to **UNVERIFIED** if the session cannot execute the proof.

## Debug Integrity

Every diagnose-mode report ends with this section. It tells the reader how much of the investigation is grounded.

- **Files read:** count
- **Hypotheses tested:** count (CONFIRMED + ADJUSTED + ELIMINATED + UNRESOLVED)
- **Categories covered:** which of Data/Logic/Timing/Environment/Configuration were tested
- **Reproduction attempted:** yes / no / partial
- **Evidence states:** OBSERVED (literal result) / INFERRED (reasoned link) / UNVERIFIED (not executed) / HUMAN-PENDING: specific human-owned check
- **Proof class:** `RUNTIME | CONTRACT-GREP | STATIC | NOT-REPRODUCED` (per `skill-preamble.md` Proof Classification)
- **Diagnostic mutations:** none / approved and tracked / cleanup incomplete
- **Footgun retrieval:** hit (cite entry) / miss / skip
- **What I Didn't Check:** files, paths, or components deliberately skipped with one-line reason each

## Investigate Mode

Investigate mode does not require reproduction, bug hypotheses, minimisation, or causal proof.

### I1 - Scope

Declare: **In scope** [files/dirs], **Out of scope** [what we skip], **Read estimate** [N files, pause at 3x].

**CHECKPOINT:** "I'll investigate [scope] reading up to [N] files. Adjust?" When the goal and scope are explicit, continue to I2 without waiting. Pause only when the goal or boundary is ambiguous, or before exceeding the declared 3x read limit.

### I2 - Read (Progressive Depth)

Read in layers: (1) entry points, (2) critical path, (3) supporting files.
For each file log: role, connections, evidence tag (OBSERVED / INFERRED).

### I3 - Report

Required: **What I Didn't Read** (skipped files + reasons), **Current vs Expected State**, **Evidence tags** (OBSERVED/INFERRED).

**BLOCKING GATE:** Present report, pause. Human decides: go deeper, switch to diagnose, or close.

## Constraints

- MUST write hypotheses AFTER initial read of the primary file
- MUST include at least 2 hypothesis categories
- MUST NOT propose fixes until human reviews diagnosis (D2 to D3 gate)
- MUST declare scope before deep reading (investigate mode)
- MUST tag diagnose evidence as OBSERVED, INFERRED, UNVERIFIED, or HUMAN-PENDING
- MUST include "What I Didn't Read" in every investigation report
- MUST check recurrence against footguns + lessons
- Universal constraints from skill-preamble.md apply.
- MUST verify fix doesn't violate architecture constraints
- MUST run D1.5 reduction before D2 or evidence a minimal, not-applicable, or unsafe disposition
- MUST NOT run `git bisect` in reporting-only or no-write mode, or without explicit approval, a clean worktree, validated refs and predicate, and a reset plan
- MUST include Debug Integrity section in every diagnose-mode report

## Output Format

Diagnose and investigate modes produce different artifacts. Use the block that matches the mode you actually ran.

### Diagnose mode (through the current gate)

Keep Quick output compact. Omit D3, D4, UI, and diagnostic-mutation fields when they are not applicable.
