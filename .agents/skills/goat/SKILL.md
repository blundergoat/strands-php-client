# /goat

## Shared Conventions

Read `.goat-flow/skill-docs/skill-preamble.md` for shared conventions.

## Boundary Commands

- **NEVER:** Investigate implementation or make changes before routing.
- **ALWAYS:** Honor explicit invocations; answer simple facts directly; otherwise split intents and emit Route Snapshots.
- **DEFER TO:** Routed skills, direct execution for simple changes, or direct answers.

**If a symptom tempts code reading, STOP.** The dispatcher routes; the routed skill investigates.

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "I can see it - routing is overhead" | Route before investigation. |
| "The user said 'just fix it'" | Route to /goat-debug. |

## How It Works

0. **EXPLICIT PASS-THROUGH** - named goat-* invocation: dispatch immediately with the remaining text as its brief; skip UNDERSTAND, GATHER, and reclassification. The target skill owns Step 0.
1. **UNDERSTAND (inferred only)** - classify intent; split multiple intents; ask only if order matters.
   - **Simple-fact fast path:** for one factual question, answer directly after UNDERSTAND; skip GATHER and the Route Snapshot.
2. **GATHER (inferred skill or direct-execution routing only)** - before routing, check:
   - Ask-first boundaries: compare request-named files with active instruction boundaries; no matching request file -> `target-files=unknown`
   - Routed skills own learning-loop retrieval; do not pre-read their learning-loop indexes in the dispatcher
   - Direct execution only: run the shared preamble's INDEX-first retrieval before emitting the Route Snapshot
   - If the boundary scan or direct-execution retrieval fails, note `gather-degraded` and route anyway
   - Only direct-execution snapshots include the retrieval result
3. **ROUTE (inferred skill or direct-execution only)** - dispatch using the map. Emit a Route Snapshot:

```
Intent: <classified user intent>
Route: </goat-* skill or direct path>
Depth: <routing depth>
Rationale: <verified routing rule and boundary state>
Relevant prior learnings: <direct route: matches | none | retrieval miss; routed skill: omit>
```

## Route Map

| Intent | Route |
|--------|-------|
| Bug, failure, unexpected behaviour; verify a fix | `/goat-debug` |
| Browser-visible issue | Browser evidence first; then `/goat-debug` (Diagnose mode) |
| Understand, explain, explore unfamiliar code | `/goat-debug` (Investigate mode) |
| GOAT Flow setup/process/harness/skills quality assessment | `goat-flow quality` CLI/dashboard prompt flow (no goat skill wrapper) |
| Code quality review, area audit, diff check | `/goat-review` |
| Multi-perspective critique | `/goat-critique` |
| Security, compliance, dependency audit | `/goat-security` |
| Testing gaps, coverage, verification planning | `/goat-qa` |
| Bare task path (no action verb) | Bare or ambiguous task paths are read-only context. Do not update `.active`, milestone status, or code from a path alone |
| Plan/design or non-trivial build/change | `/goat-plan`; build/change carries `return-to-implement`, plan/design stops after planning |
| Simple implementation (single-file, obvious) | No skill; use execution loop directly |
| Simple question | Answer directly |

## Constraints

- MUST respect explicit skill invocations - no reclassification
- MUST NOT investigate implementation or make changes before routing; the Simple-fact fast path may read only the minimum source or reference needed to answer
- MUST understand intent conversationally, not via keyword lookup - 0-2 clarification questions max; route with stated assumption if still ambiguous
- MUST emit a Route Snapshot for every inferred skill or direct-execution dispatch - simple-fact answers are exempt
- MUST split multi-intent requests into numbered intents and route each
- MUST pass brief/depth and preserve context; `return-to-implement` preserves build authorization, but Ask First boundaries still gate
