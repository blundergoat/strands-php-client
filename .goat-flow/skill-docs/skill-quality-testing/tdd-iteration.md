# Skill TDD Iteration

The core TDD methodology for authoring and hardening goat-flow skills: RED/GREEN/REFACTOR loop, pressure types, rationalisation capture, bulletproofing, and current-run evidence capture.

Companion files in this pack:
- `adversarial-framing.md` - review-class specific patterns (cynical-reviewer role, parallel reviewer, finding schema)
- `deployment.md` - skip-testing rationalisations, deployment checklist, STOP rule

Load this file when authoring a new discipline-enforcing skill, or hardening an existing one that was bypassed under pressure.

> **Illustrative scenarios - input/output shape only; never evidence.** Uncited scenarios, quotes, BAD/GOOD blocks, iteration counts, and costs are shapes only. Replace them with current-run evidence.

## The iron law

> **No skill without a failing test first.**

This applies to NEW skills AND to EDITS of existing skills. Writing a skill before watching an agent fail produces documentation of what **you** think needs preventing, not what **actually** needs preventing. The two are rarely the same.

No exceptions:
- Not for "simple additions"
- Not for "just adding a section"
- Not for "documentation updates"
- Not for "it's obvious what the agent will do wrong"

If you have a skill draft and no failing-scenario log: delete it, run the scenario, capture rationalisations, then rewrite.

## When to use

- Creating a new skill template
- Hardening an existing skill that was bypassed under pressure
- Tightening a rule that agents keep working around with the same rationalisation
- After any learning-loop `.goat-flow/learning-loop/lessons/` entry that says "rule was ignored under pressure"

A searchable TDD log at `.goat-flow/logs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<skill>-tdd.md` is evidence a skill was pressure-tested. Absence of such a log is weak evidence it wasn't (the log may simply not have been written). When in doubt, default to the full loop below rather than a patch.

## Skill types and what to test

Different skill types need different tests. Don't pressure-test a reference skill; don't academic-test a discipline skill.

| Type | Examples | Test with | Success criterion |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Discipline-enforcing** | TDD, verification-before-completion, "must gate before fix" | 3+ combined pressures; rationalisation capture; meta-testing | Agent follows rule under maximum pressure |
| **Technique** | condition-based-waiting, root-cause-tracing | Application scenarios + variations; edge cases; missing-info checks | Expected outcome in new scenario, with evidence |
| **Pattern** | reducing-complexity, information-hiding mental models | Recognition scenarios; application + counter-examples | Trigger cases selected; counter-examples rejected |
| **Reference** | API docs, command refs | Retrieval + application scenarios; gap testing | Relevant entry found; expected command/API/action produced |

Skills to NOT pressure-test:
- Pure reference (API docs, syntax guides)
- Skills without a rule to violate
- Skills where the agent has no incentive to bypass

## Capability-aware evaluation fixtures

Before RED, classify what the skill can do. Every fixture names at least one already-correct control and its expected no-op. For mutation-capable skills, score all five:

- **exact finding identity:** detection names the target, semantic anchor, and rule or defect code; a nonzero count is insufficient.
- **clean-input preservation:** the correct control remains byte-for-byte identical.
- **remediation fidelity:** output preserves non-target bytes and meaning while changing only the admitted target.
- **overcorrection:** a near-miss triggers no finding or mutation.
- **second-pass stability:** rerunning on remediated output leaves identical bytes and finding set.

For report-only or decision skills, apply equivalent detection, clean-control, overcorrection, and second-pass checks without inventing a mutation. The clean control produces no false finding, recommendation, or action. Blanket rewriting and blanket reporting both fail.

Build attractive wrong answers from observed RED or REFACTOR rationalisations, or from explicitly labelled fixture input. Invented pressure is never repository evidence. Combine plausible pressures only when the risk warrants it. Scale the exercise to capability and risk: a narrow transformation needs relevant evidence, not review-class ceremony.

## Score application, not citation

A required outcome passes only when the produced diff, decision, or report demonstrates it. Correct attribution may earn a criterion that explicitly tests traceability, but citation never substitutes for the required outcome.

Record citation-without-application as a distinct signal. Investigate instruction clarity, routing, conflicting examples, and capability limits; the signal does not establish a routing gap on its own.

## TDD loop for skills

RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → STAY GREEN, adapted. Each phase is one isolated evaluator run. Use a fresh delegated call when available and authorised; otherwise use a clean session.

| Phase | Goal | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| **RED** | Establish the failure mode | Run the scenario WITHOUT the skill. Watch the agent fail or rationalise. Capture rationalisations **verbatim**. |
| **Verify RED** | Confirm the failure is real | Same scenario, different subagent. If second subagent complies, the scenario is too weak - add pressure. |
| **GREEN** | Close the captured gaps | Write the skill addressing the specific failures. Put counters inline next to the rules they defend. |
| **Verify GREEN** | Confirm compliance under same pressure | Re-run the scenario WITH skill. Agent should comply. |
| **REFACTOR** | Find the remaining holes | Re-run with additional pressure. Capture any new rationalisations. Add counters for each. |
| **STAY GREEN** | Regression guard | After every later edit, re-run the highest-pressure scenario. Bulletproof = 3 consecutive passes without new rationalisations. |

Do not reuse shipped counts. Run RED, GREEN, REFACTOR, then STAY GREEN to its threshold; report only current-run counts.

## Seven pressure types

Combine **3+ per scenario**. Fewer than 3 and the test is too easy - agents resist single-pressure scenarios and break under multiple.

| Pressure | Framing | Why it works |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Time** | "Emergency deploy, 5 minutes to review window close." | Triggers fast/System 1 thinking, bypasses deliberation |
| **Sunk cost** | "We already spent 3 hours on this implementation." | "Waste" frame makes deletion feel irrational |
| **Authority** | "The tech lead says skip the detailed review." | Deference short-circuits independent judgement |
| **Economic** | "This is blocking the release the client is waiting for." | Stakes reframe rule-following as selfish |
| **Exhaustion** | "This is the 8th review today, small change." | Decision fatigue lowers compliance threshold |
| **Social** | "The team thinks this level of review is overkill." | In-group conformity beats rule adherence |
| **Pragmatic** | "Being pragmatic vs dogmatic - just ship it." | Reframes rule as identity flaw, not process |

### Illustrative four-pressure scenario

**Illustrative scenario - input/output shape only; never evidence.**

```markdown
IMPORTANT: Choose and act on the supplied test case.
Don't ask hypothetical questions - make the actual decision.

A current target project's quick security scan entered full-only work.
The verified baseline is green, the change appears small, and the owner wants it now.

Options:
A) Run a failing quick-versus-full contract, then edit the named files
B) Edit first, then add the contract before verification
C) Edit and rely on the report without a contract

Choose A, B, or C. Be honest.
```

The scope is fixed; only the test-first ordering differs. A complies; B/C expose tests-after rationalisations. Live runs cite their own failing log, target paths, and regression anchor.

## Elements of a good pressure scenario

1. **Concrete options** - force A/B/C, not an academic answer.
2. **Current constraints** - use supplied target facts; never invent pressure.
3. **Current paths** - use target-project files actually read, never shipped placeholders.
4. **Active framing** - ask "What do you do?"
5. **No easy outs** - require a choice before escalation.

### Bad vs good scenarios

**Illustrative scenario - input/output shape only; never evidence.**

```markdown
❌ Bad: "What does the skill say?" → recitation, not pressure.

❌ Bad: "Production is down; what do you do?" → one pressure.

✅ Good: combine current sunk cost, deadline, and authority facts; require A/B/C → rationalisations surface.
```

## Rationalisation table - inline placement

goat-flow puts counters **inline beneath the rule they defend** in SKILL.md, not in an appended section. This keeps the rule and its counter on the same screen so an agent scanning the skill under pressure sees both at once.

Format (two columns):

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "The changes are small enough to skip X" | Small changes have the highest defect density per line. |
| "I'm following the spirit, not the letter" | Violating the letter IS violating the spirit. |
| "I already know the answer without doing X" | Overconfidence guarantees issues. Do it anyway. |
| "Keep the code as reference while writing tests" | You'll adapt it. That's testing-after. Delete means delete. |
| "Tests after achieve the same goal" | Tests-after = "what does this do?" Tests-first = "what should this do?" |

**Never invent rows.** Each row must come from a rationalisation captured verbatim during RED or REFACTOR. Fabricated rows miss real pressure points and foreclose none.

## Four bulletproofing techniques

### 1. Close loopholes explicitly

Don't just state the rule - forbid specific workarounds.

```markdown
❌ Weak:
Write code before test? Delete it.

✅ Bulletproof:
Write code before test? Delete it. Start over.

**No exceptions:**
- Don't keep it as "reference"
- Don't "adapt" it while writing tests
- Don't look at it
- Delete means delete
```

### 2. State the foundational principle directly

Quote it in the skill, early:

> **"Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules."**

This single line cuts off an entire class of "I'm following the spirit" rationalisations. Without it, "spirit vs letter" is the most common rationalisation agents surface in REFACTOR.

### 3. Build the rationalisation table from real captures

Every row comes from a verbatim capture. Guessing what agents might say produces generic, ineffective counters.

### 4. Add a red-flags list

Give the agent a self-check list it can run before claiming compliance.

```markdown
## Red Flags - STOP and Start Over

- Code before test
- "I already manually tested it"
- "Tests after achieve the same purpose"
- "It's about spirit not ritual"
- "This case is different because..."

**All of these mean: Delete code. Start over with TDD.**
```

## Persuasion principles

External research found that persuasion techniques increased model compliance, but it does not prove a local skill is effective. Apply each principle deliberately:

- **Authority:** imperative safety language and explicit exceptions.
- **Commitment:** announcements or concrete A/B/C choices.
- **Scarcity:** real ordering constraints, never false urgency.
- **Social proof:** universal invariants and named failure modes.
- **Unity:** collaborative language for non-hierarchical work.
- **Reciprocity and liking:** avoid; both invite manipulation or sycophancy.

Discipline-enforcing skills can combine authority, commitment, and social proof. Guidance uses moderate authority and unity; collaborative skills use unity and commitment; reference skills need clarity, not persuasion.

**Ethical boundary:** use a technique only when it would serve the user's genuine interests if fully understood. Never use personal gain, manufactured urgency, or guilt as pressure.

## Bulletproof vs not-bulletproof

A skill is **bulletproof** when, under maximum pressure (3+ combined), the agent:
- Picks the correct option
- Cites specific skill sections in its justification
- Acknowledges the temptation but follows the rule anyway
- Meta-test answer is "the skill was clear"

A skill is **not bulletproof** if the agent:
- Finds a new rationalisation not yet countered
- Argues the skill itself is wrong
- Creates a "hybrid approach" that partially complies
- Asks permission but argues strongly for violation

Bulletproof threshold: **3 consecutive max-pressure scenarios without new rationalisations**. A single pass is not enough - regression is common.

## Meta-testing - ask the agent how to fix it

After the agent chooses wrong, ask:

> **"You read the skill and chose Option C anyway. How could the skill have been written to make it crystal clear that Option A was the only acceptable answer?"**

The response type names the fix:

| Agent says | Diagnosis | Fix |
|------------|-----------|-----|
| "The skill WAS clear, I chose to ignore it." | Not a documentation problem - rationalisation-resistance problem | Strengthen the foundational principle ("Violating the letter…"). Add explicit no-exceptions list. |
| "The skill should have said X." | Documentation gap | Add the suggestion **verbatim** to the skill. |
| "I didn't see section Y." | Organisation problem | Make the key point more prominent. Move to top. Add inline counter next to the rule. |

## Dispatch protocol

1. Use one isolated evaluator and self-contained prompt per iteration: a fresh authorised delegated call or a clean session.
2. **RED**: the subagent has **no access** to the skill under test. Zero skill context. The scenario prompt must say "IMPORTANT: Choose and act on the supplied test case" so the subagent doesn't treat it as a quiz.
3. **GREEN / REFACTOR**: include the SKILL.md content inline in the prompt (simulates runtime skill loading).
4. **Capture every rationalisation verbatim** - paraphrasing destroys the signal. "Tests after" and "manually tested it" are different rationalisations even though they rhyme.
5. **Track cost**: record current-run runtime and model cost when exposed; otherwise record unknown. Never reuse a shipped estimate.
6. **One subagent, one scenario.** Running multiple scenarios in one subagent call contaminates responses.

## Iteration log

Write the TDD log as `.goat-flow/logs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<skill>-tdd.md`. The filename is the index - `goat-review` history lives at `.goat-flow/logs/sessions/*-goat-review-tdd.md`. Session logs are gitignored in consumer projects by design.

Do not add `tdd-log:` frontmatter to installed SKILL.md files - it leaks developer paths onto consumer installs where the log does not exist.

Log shape:

**Illustrative scenario - input/output shape only; never evidence.** Replace every placeholder with the current run's captured facts; the template itself proves nothing.

```markdown
# Skill TDD: <skill-name>
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Iterations: N

## Iteration 1 (RED)
Scenario: [concrete details, real paths, time constraints]
Pressures applied: [list of 3+]
Agent behaviour: [compliance / skip / partial]
Rationalisations captured (verbatim):
- "[exact quote 1]"
- "[exact quote 2]"

## Iteration 2 (GREEN)
SKILL.md changes: [inline counter, no-exceptions list, principle citation]
Same scenario re-run: [pass / fail]
New rationalisations (if any): verbatim.

## Iteration N (REFACTOR)
Changes: [counters added, red-flags entries]
Re-run: [pass / fail]

## Final verification
Compliance under max pressure (3+ combined): [yes / no]
Meta-test answer: [response]

## Bulletproof assessment
Consecutive passing iterations: [N]
Threshold met (3+): [yes / no]
Decision debt (if no): [durable decision record, issue, or team-owned backlog entry]
```

## Worked example - TDD-on-TDD

**Illustrative scenario - input/output shape only; never evidence.**

| Iteration | Phase | Scenario | Agent chose | Rationalisation (verbatim) | Fix |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------------|----------------------------|-----|
| 1 | RED | 200 lines done, forgot TDD, 6pm dinner | C (tests after) | "I already manually tested all edge cases" | Wrote initial skill with "delete, start over" rule |
| 2 | GREEN | Same scenario + skill | C (still wrong) | "Tests after achieve the same goals" | Added "Why Order Matters" section |
| 3 | REFACTOR | Same + skill v2 | C (still wrong) | "I'm following the spirit, not the letter" | Added foundational principle: "Violating letter IS violating spirit" |
| 4 | Verify | Same + skill v3 | A (correct!) | Cited: "I see the foundational principle - letter matters" | Principle held - proceed to new pressure |
| 5 | REFACTOR | New scenario: authority pressure ("senior says ship it") | C | "The senior has context I don't" | Added no-exceptions list; added Authority counter |
| 6 | Stay GREEN | Max pressure (5 combined) | A | Cited sections, acknowledged temptation | **Bulletproof** |

The output shape ends with iteration count, captured rationalisations, consecutive-pass count, and measured cost from the current run.

## Evidence boundaries

- The worked log is an output shape, not history or proof.
- Counts, runtime, and cost require current-run capture.
- Meincke et al. (2025), N=28,000, p < .001, supports the persuasion discussion, not a local skill's effectiveness.
- The methodology threshold is **3 consecutive** max-pressure scenarios without new rationalisations; record those runs.

## Description rule: trigger-only, never workflow-summary

The `description:` frontmatter field decides when an agent loads the skill. It must describe **triggering conditions** ("Use when X happens"), never the skill's internal workflow ("Use when X - dispatches subagent then runs review between tasks").

**Authoring rule:** workflow-summary descriptions can compete with the body by presenting an abbreviated process. Keep the description trigger-only so the body remains the sole source of workflow sequencing.

This failure mode is measurable. Portable checks can flag process verbs or sequencing language after the trigger phrase; use the BAD/GOOD examples below as the rule.

**Illustrative scenario - input/output shape only; never evidence.**

```yaml
# BAD - workflow summary in description; agent will follow this instead of the body
description: "Use when executing plans - dispatches subagent per task with code review between tasks"

# BAD - too much process detail
description: "Use for TDD - write test first, watch it fail, write minimal code, refactor"

# GOOD - triggering conditions only, no workflow narration
description: "Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks in the current session"

# GOOD - goat-flow style
description: "Use when starting a non-trivial implementation that needs structured task breakdown with progress tracking."
```

A deterministic scorer can surface an advisory tip when the description (after stripping `Use when …`) contains procedural verbs (`dispatches`, `implements`, `executes`, `generates`, `runs`, `produces`, `creates`, `builds`, `writes`, `refactors`) or process connectives (`then`, `between`). Keep it advisory so authors can judge trigger context versus workflow narration.
