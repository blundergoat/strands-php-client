# Hook Policy Testing

Use this playbook after changing deny-hook policy, registration, or packaging.
It helps an agent prove dangerous commands stay blocked while ordinary user work
stays available, and confirms every supported agent loads the central hook.

## Availability Check

From the selected project's root, run the bounded installed-policy check:

```bash
test -x .goat-flow/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh &&
  bash .goat-flow/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh --self-test=smoke
```

Availability is proven only when the command exits `0` and ends with a `PASS`
summary for the requested mode:

```text
PASS: deny-dangerous self-test (mode=smoke, executed=<count>, skipped=0)
```

`<count>` tracks the installed policy corpus, so it differs by project and grows
as cases are added. Record this project's number as its baseline and compare
later runs against that, not against any figure quoted here. Cases skip only
when a hook filter narrows the run, so an unfiltered `skipped=0` with a non-zero
count is the passing shape.

If the installed hook is absent, stop and repair setup or select the correct
project. Do not substitute the workflow-source hook as proof that a consumer's
installed policy works.

## Intent

The deny hook protects users from destructive shell, secret access, and
repository writes. Policy testing proves three separate outcomes:

1. dangerous command grammar is denied;
2. a nearby harmless control remains allowed;
3. canonical policy, installed policy, and agent registration still agree.

The smoke suite is an availability check. The full suite is the release and
policy-change gate.

## Boundary

This playbook owns policy verification, mirror checks, and registration checks.
It does not teach regex design, invent new deny categories, or authorize an
agent to run a blocked command. In particular, coding agents never commit or
push; the user performs repository publication actions.

Use `--check='<command>'` only as classifier input. It asks the hook how it would
classify text and does not execute that command.

## Policy-Test Workflow

### 1. Establish the installed baseline

Run the Availability Check before editing. Then run the complete corpus:

```bash
bash .goat-flow/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh --self-test=full
```

Record the literal summary line and exit status. A failing baseline is an
existing regression, not evidence caused by the proposed change.

### 2. Reproduce the policy grammar

When this step runs inside an agent session, provider Bash settings may match guarded text in the
quoted `--check` operand before this hook starts. A settings-layer denial with no `BLOCKED:` policy
output is not a hook classifier result. Record that denial separately; do not split or reconstruct
guarded text to evade it.

Use the sanctioned self-test for corpus coverage. If an exact one-off shape still needs classification,
write the provider event to a gitignored JSON payload file with a non-Bash file tool, then pass that
file on stdin using a command line that contains only its path. This keeps the guarded phrase in stdin,
not provider-matched command text, so the resulting hook output has a truthful attribution boundary.

For each policy behaviour, test a denied shape and a neighbouring allowed
control. This prevents a broad matcher from making ordinary terminal work
unusable.

```bash
bash .goat-flow/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh --check="bash -lc 'git push'"
bash .goat-flow/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh --check="git status"
```

Expected results:

- the push shape exits `2` with a `BLOCKED: Policy repository:` message;
- `git status` exits `0` with no denial message.

Add both cases to the central self-test when a policy edit introduces new
grammar. A deny-only test proves blocking but misses false positives; an
allow-only test proves usability but misses bypasses.

### 3. Run wrapper and compound-command shapes

These measured push shapes must all remain denied:

```bash
# Each wrapper represents a measured path a user's request could take to the hook.
for command_shape in \
  "bash -lc 'git push'" \
  "env -i git push" \
  "if true; then git push; fi" \
  'f(){ git push; }; f'
do
  bash .goat-flow/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh --check="$command_shape"
  printf 'exit=%s\n' "$?"
done
```

On 2026-07-14, each shape exited `2` with:

```text
BLOCKED: Policy repository: git push is not allowed. Ask the user to push manually.
```

The exact wrapper matters. For example, a user may ask an agent to inspect a
release script containing `bash -lc`; the recursive command body must still be
classified rather than trusted as inert wrapper text.

### 4. Verify installed policy and available canonical source

The dispatcher and its policy modules are one runtime unit. Always verify the
installed policy that protects the user's selected project:

```bash
bash .goat-flow/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh --self-test=full

# Framework maintainers also prove the source that future consumers will install.
if test -f workflow/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh; then
  diff -q workflow/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh .goat-flow/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh
  diff -qr workflow/hooks/deny-dangerous .goat-flow/hooks/deny-dangerous
  bash workflow/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh --self-test=full
fi
```

In the controlling workspace, either dispatcher resolves policy modules from
the installed `.goat-flow/hooks/deny-dangerous/` store. Therefore dispatcher
parity alone is insufficient: keep the module directories byte-identical and
run the installed full corpus.

### 5. Verify agent registration

Every supported agent must call the installed central dispatcher rather than a
private copy. Confirm current configuration and manifest pointers:

```bash
registration_files=()

# Check only registration files present in the user's selected project.
for registration_file in \
  .claude/settings.json \
  .codex/hooks.json \
  .github/hooks/hooks.json \
  .agents/hooks.json \
  workflow/manifest.json
do
  # A present file can prove that the user's agent loads the central dispatcher.
  if test -f "$registration_file"; then
    registration_files+=("$registration_file")
  fi
done

# No supported file means this project has no registration surface to verify.
if test "${#registration_files[@]}" -eq 0; then
  printf '%s\n' 'No supported agent registration files found.' >&2
  exit 1
fi

# Ripgrep is not installed on every consumer machine; POSIX grep always is.
if command -v rg >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  rg -n --with-filename \
    '\.goat-flow/hooks/deny-dangerous\.sh' "${registration_files[@]}"
else
  grep -nHE \
    '\.goat-flow/hooks/deny-dangerous\.sh' "${registration_files[@]}"
fi
```

Then run the structural checks that detect packaging or registration drift:

```bash
goat-flow manifest --check
goat-flow audit . --check-drift --format json
```

A green classifier with a missing config pointer does not protect the user's
session. A correct config pointer with stale policy modules protects against
the wrong command set. Both layers must pass.

### 6. Run the bounded managed-hook proof

Use this deeper checkout-specific proof when validating managed hook registration
and classifier behavior. The CLI must be available, and the selected agent must
have the installed deny hook configured in a trusted checkout.

```bash
goat-flow hooks verify . --agent <id> --scenario deny-hook --trusted-target
```

The command passes four fixed inert classifier operands to the managed script as
`--check` arguments; it inspects but never executes those operands. A proven run
exits `0`, reports `pass` for all four scenarios, and records one local
`hook.verify` event per scenario. `fail`, `unsupported`, `not-configured`,
`error`, or a missing evidence event means the requested proof is incomplete.

The selected checkout's hook code runs only with `--trusted-target`. Omit that
flag until you have inspected and trust the checkout; the CLI then returns
explicit `unsupported` results without starting the hook, so the safe default
is not classifier proof. The deprecated `--untrusted-target` flag remains an
explicit static alias throughout v1.16.x.

This command proves only the selected checkout's managed script, registration
state, and four fixed decisions. It does not launch the external coding agent
and does not prove provider-side hook delivery. Never cite it as external-agent
delivery evidence.

## Verification Gate

After any hook-policy or registration change, require all of the following:

- installed smoke suite passes;
- installed and workflow full suites pass;
- every new deny case has a nearby allow control;
- dispatcher and policy-module mirrors are identical;
- supported agent configs point to the installed central dispatcher;
- any requested managed-hook proof reports four passes and recorded events;
- manifest, drift audit, shell syntax, and ShellCheck pass;
- the original bypass or false-positive reproduction now has the intended exit.

Do not claim a fix from the suite alone. Re-run the exact command shape that
demonstrated the failure and report its literal output.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | User-visible meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Availability Check exits `1` before the self-test | The selected project has no executable installed hook | Confirm the project root, then repair installation rather than testing workflow source |
| Exit `126` or `127` | The hook or required shell cannot start | Check executable state and `bash` availability; do not treat this as a policy verdict |
| `Policy hook unavailable` names a missing module | The dispatcher exists but its central policy store is incomplete | Compare both policy-module directories and repair packaging |
| Denied case exits `0` | A dangerous grammar shape bypasses the classifier | Preserve the exact shape, add paired RED coverage, and stop release verification |
| Allowed control exits non-zero | The matcher blocks ordinary user work | Preserve the control, narrow the policy under a separately approved change, and rerun the full corpus |
| Source passes but installed hook fails | Users received stale or incomplete policy | Reconcile source/install mirrors and rerun consumer installation checks |
