# Gruff Code Quality

Use this when the user asks to run or fix findings from `gruff-go`, `gruff-rs`, `gruff-ts`, `gruff-php`, or `gruff-py`. Gruff is static analysis: it reports quality findings; it does not replace tests, typecheck, lint, or maintainer judgment.

You are a coding agent. Your job is to run the right gruff tool, fix one cohesive cluster, prove the finding changed with a targeted rerun, then run the normal project verification.

## Availability Check

Set `target` from the requested language; another gruff binary is not enough.

Start with project-declared paths and wrappers. A repo-relative
`hooks.gruff-code-quality.binaries.<go|rs|ts|php|py>` path in
`.goat-flow/config.yaml` is explicit project authority for a non-standard or nested install; verify
that it is executable and remains inside the project. Look for a wrapper in `bin/`, `bin/test/`,
`scripts/`, or package scripts, inspect what it invokes, and prefer it for the capabilities it owns.
Wrappers often preserve the working directory, config discovery, or exit-code contract that a raw
binary call would lose. Do not assume a wrapper forwards raw-binary flags such as `--version`,
`--help`, or `--format`.

Availability discovery only inspects wrappers and existing executable paths. It never invokes a package resolver, installer, init command, or dependency-fetching wrapper. Run a wrapper only after inspection proves it uses an already-present executable.

```bash
target=gruff-ts  # gruff-go | gruff-rs | gruff-ts | gruff-php | gruff-py
wrapper=
for candidate in \
  "bin/test/$target-analyse.sh" \
  "bin/$target-analyse.sh" \
  "scripts/$target-analyse.sh"
do
  if [ -x "$candidate" ]; then wrapper="$candidate"; break; fi
done

found=
for candidate in \
  "target/release/$target" \
  "bin/$target" \
  "vendor/bin/$target" \
  "vendor/blundergoat/$target/bin/$target" \
  "node_modules/.bin/$target" \
  "node_modules/@blundergoat/$target/bin/$target" \
  ".venv/bin/$target" \
  ".cargo-tools/bin/$target" \
  "$HOME/.local/bin/$target" \
  "$target"
do
  if [ -x "$candidate" ]; then found="$candidate"; break; fi
  if command -v "$candidate" >/dev/null 2>&1; then found="$(command -v "$candidate")"; break; fi
done
test -n "$found"
"$found" --version
"$found" --help
```

Run this from the selected project or owning subproject root. Standard package shims precede their
direct package binaries; the direct Composer and npm paths are fallbacks for installs whose shim is
missing. Inspect `$wrapper` before using it. Do not recursively execute name-matched binaries from
arbitrary child directories; configure an exact repo-relative path for a deliberately nested tool.

If no existing executable is found, say gruff is unavailable and use the project's normal lint/typecheck/tests; do not resolve tooling or invent gruff findings.

## Project Authority

Project-owned Gruff configuration and accepted quality conventions control analyzer vocabulary, thresholds, wrappers, and suppressions. If no designated project standard covers a choice, use this playbook's generic default. Explicit current instructions and the authoritative project hierarchy take precedence. Configuration and defaults cannot override safety, accepted architecture, verified facts, evidence requirements, or verification gates.

## Intent

Gruff work is a loop:

1. Measure.
2. Pick one cohesive cluster.
3. Fix root causes, not symptoms.
4. Rerun gruff on touched paths.
5. Run normal verification for the changed code.

Never claim a gruff finding is fixed from inspection. The targeted gruff rerun is the reproduction.

## Tool vs Target

When the user names a path, classify it before reading deeply:

- **TOOL:** gruff checkout/package/binary/CLI reference to invoke.
- **TARGET:** codebase or paths to scan/fix.

If the user says "use X to find Y" and X has a binary, package metadata, or CLI README, treat X as the tool and Y as the target. If both readings remain plausible, ask one question before planning or editing.

## Command Selection

Use the smallest command that answers the question. Examples use `gruff-ts`; substitute the installed binary.

```bash
gruff-ts summary
gruff-ts analyse src/payments/charge.ts
gruff-ts analyse --diff working-tree
gruff-ts analyse --format json src/payments/charge.ts
gruff-ts check-ignore src/generated/schema.ts
gruff-ts list-rules --format json
```

- Use `summary` for orientation.
- Use `analyse <path>` while fixing.
- Use `analyse --format json` for grouping or exact counts.
- Use `check-ignore <path>` to verify a config ignore before planning CONFIGURE/SKIP.
- Use `dashboard` or `report` only when the installed tool exposes it and the user needs an artifact.

Exit codes matter: `analyse` may exit `1` because findings exist; that is not tool failure. Exit `2` is a real diagnostic such as parse error, missing path, or rejected config. Confirm the threshold flag against `analyse --help` for the exact binary; use its pure-reporting value when supported and do not infer a shared spelling across ports.

## JSON Triage

For large reports:

1. Run `analyse --format json <paths>` and save output outside tracked source.
2. Inspect the top-level keys before scripting against the schema.
3. Group by `ruleId`, file, pillar, and symbol.
4. Prefer `stableIdentity` for finding diffs; line numbers and `fingerprint` move with edits.

Current ports are converging on `schemaVersion: "gruff.analysis.v2"` and flat findings with `ruleId`, `message`, `file`, `line`, `severity`, `pillar`, `symbol`, `metadata`, `fingerprint`, and `stableIdentity`. Verify the installed version; older releases and ports differ.

If JSON is empty or non-JSON, suspect a real diagnostic or config `schemaVersion` failure before assuming the schema changed.

## Comment and Documentation Passes

Before editing comments, run Gruff on the exact paths and keep the before-edit JSON outside tracked source. Re-run the same paths afterwards and compare introduced, removed, and unchanged `stableIdentity` values. Zero introduced identities means no new finding; legitimate removals are fine. Aggregate equality is not proof because one finding can replace another without changing totals.

A clean Gruff run does not prove comment meaning. Gruff checks detectable presence and shape; a reviewer still verifies claims against the code they describe.

Disposition each introduced stable identity; a histogram is insufficient. When applying project
authority introduces a finding, read the full rule and look for a form that satisfies both. If none
exists, project authority wins and the receipt records the introduced identity, rule conflict, and
reason. Never revert a correct edit silently or report the analyzer as clean.

A documentation pass edits comments and doc blocks. Route every naming finding through [`naming-and-placement.md`](./naming-and-placement.md); a documentation pass grants no rename, extraction, signature-change, or other structural authority. List each separately authorized rename where the change is described. A comment that already meets the `code-comments.md` bar is out of scope - rewrite only on a diagnosed defect, and do not re-align untouched tag columns or reflow compliant lines unless a formatter enforces it.

The identity diff proves no new finding, not that the pass earned its review cost. Report compliant comments left untouched and any whitespace-only churn, and size the pass like any cluster: one subsystem a human can actually review, not the whole tree.

Read the JSON from stdout alone. The wrapper writes progress lines to stderr, so merging the streams corrupts the document. Redirect to a file and read the file rather than piping into an inline interpreter, which a project deny policy may block.

## Triage Actions

Classify high-volume rules before editing individual findings.

| Action | Use when | Agent response |
|---|---|---|
| APPLY | True positive and small enough to fix | Fix in batches. |
| APPLY-WITH-CHECK | Useful rule with false positives | Sample and verify each edit. |
| CONFIGURE | Project vocabulary/threshold is valid | Tune config with rationale. |
| BASELINE | Remaining findings are accepted debt | Baseline only after cleanup, with notes. |
| LARGER-REFACTOR | Real issue needs bigger design work | Report; do not smuggle refactor. |
| SKIP-CODEBASE | Rule conflicts with deliberate convention | Document and avoid churn. |

Hard rule: never set `enabled: false` and never baseline mid-cleanup. If the user asked to "fix", do not tune thresholds or baselines unless they explicitly approve that policy change.

Before CONFIGURE or BASELINE, run one exact true positive and one known-good negative control with the same executable, command shape, and proposed config. The positive must emit the expected rule ID and target identity exposed by the installed port; the negative control emits no finding for that rule. Stop the policy change if either identity or disposition moves unexpectedly.

## Cluster Choice

Fix one cluster small enough to verify:

- one file;
- one rule family across adjacent files;
- one public contract plus its tests;
- one generated/config path decision.

Prioritize security/correctness, unsafe modernisation, naming that removes confusion, documentation of hidden contracts, real complexity risk, then test-quality signal. Do not chase composite score as proof; high-count accepted debt can dominate it.

## Fix Loop

For each cluster:

1. Read source and nearby tests.
2. Read rule source for high-volume, surprising, security-sensitive, or potentially breaking findings.
3. Apply only separately authorized naming or structural remedies, then comment where verified intent remains hidden.
4. Patch the code.
5. Rerun gruff on touched paths.
6. Run compile/typecheck, lint/format, and focused tests for the changed language.
7. Stop when targeted gruff is clean or each remaining finding is CONFIGURE, BASELINE, LARGER-REFACTOR, or SKIP-CODEBASE.

## Documentation Findings

For `docs.*`, load [`code-comments.md`](./code-comments.md) first. A missing-doc finding is a candidate,
not proof that prose is required. Apply it when project or language canon requires documentation,
when the symbol is a public/exported API, or when a file/module/class boundary has a non-obvious
contract. Otherwise classify the finding against the project's deliberate no-doc convention. When a
doc comment is required, meet the playbook's block shape and the applicable formatter or fallback ceiling; do not add the
shortest line that merely silences the analyzer.

Write comments for caller-visible contract: obligations, edge values, side effects, error behavior, thresholds, determinism, compatibility, or non-obvious rationale. Do not restate syntax or add marker words just to satisfy the analyzer. If `@param`/`@returns` tags are used, each tag needs meaning beyond the type signature.

Rule scopes differ by port: gruff-ts can flag internal helpers; gruff-py covers every function; gruff-go/rust mostly cover public/exported docs; gruff-php focuses on public/class/file/constant phpdoc. The rule IDs use `docs.`, while the pillar is `documentation`.

Test functions follow the useful-contract gate. A descriptive test name and assertions often need no
comment; document only a non-obvious test contract, and do not expand tests into contract essays.

A per-dependency missing-doc finding is an accepted false positive only for an obvious non-null service-only constructor whose intent is already documented. A scalar, optional, configured, or side-effectful input is not pure DI and remains a finding.

## Naming Findings

For `naming.*`, load [`naming-and-placement.md`](./naming-and-placement.md). It owns role, terminology,
cardinality, time, placement, guard, and compatibility boundaries. A Gruff finding diagnoses a candidate;
it never authorizes a rename or structural change. After any separately authorized rename, grep the old
identifier and run the relevant typecheck and tests.

Use `allowlists.acceptedAbbreviations` for accepted project vocabulary instead of fighting the same naming finding repeatedly.

## Finding-Specific Guardrails

- Complexity is not an automatic refactor order. Extract only when the result is clearer and safer.
- Modernisation can change narrowing or public types; run the type checker.
- Generic type narrowing is good only when the boundary contract is known.
- Test-quality findings ask whether the test has signal. Do not add no-op helpers, fake SUT calls, or wrappers to game the rule.
- Data-driven test loops are good when each row asserts behavior; do not de-parametrize to clear a loop smell.
- Mock-only tests need real assertions: capture-spy arguments or assert observable output/state.
- PHP `$callable()` -> `$callable->__invoke()` is safe only when the value is known invokable.
- Empty/silent catches need real handling plus rationale if swallowing is intentional.
- High-entropy MIME/path/rule strings and telemetry token metric names may be accepted false positives; do not reduce readability to game entropy.
- `createMock` -> `createStub` does not by itself clear mock-without-expectation.
- Report a documentation-caused size finding such as `size.file-length` or `size.class-length`; do not trim requested meaning, and do not smuggle in a file split or a rename during a documentation pass.

## Baselines and Reports

Baselines are debt tracking, not cleanup:

```bash
<gruff-binary> analyse --generate-baseline .gruff-baseline.json
<gruff-binary> analyse --baseline .gruff-baseline.json
```

Generate or update a baseline only after remaining findings are deliberately accepted debt, with notes explaining why. Reports are evidence artifacts, not a substitute for source edits or targeted reruns.

## Progress Reporting

Report targeted deltas, not only global score. The following is an illustrative output shape, not evidence of a real scan:

```text
Fixed:
- tool: gruff-ts <version>
- docs.missing-error-behavior-doc: 12 -> 0 on src/payments
- naming.short-variable: 9 -> 1 on test helpers

Pass hygiene (documentation pass):
- compliant comments left untouched: 214
- whitespace-only churn: 0 lines
- renames: 2 local, listed in the PR body

Remaining:
- complexity.cognitive in renderTextOutput: LARGER-REFACTOR
- naming.* public API params: SKIP to avoid breaking callers
```

## Verification Gate

Before claiming gruff work is done:

1. Show the exact targeted gruff rerun for every touched cluster.
2. Show compile/typecheck for the edited language.
3. Show focused tests for behavior, fixture, or public-shape changes.
4. Show lint/format if style or TS/JS changed.
5. Confirm no `enabled: false` rule disablement was added.
6. Confirm no mid-cleanup baseline was generated.
7. For separately authorized renames, follow `naming-and-placement.md` and grep the old identifier.
8. For doc findings, confirm `code-comments.md` bar was followed.
9. For a documentation pass, compare before/after identities and report any documentation-caused size finding, the untouched-compliant count, and every rename.
10. For CONFIGURE or BASELINE, show the exact true-positive and known-good negative-control results.
11. Report remaining findings by action category, not as "fixed".

## Troubleshooting

- **Comment exists but finding remains:** it may be attached to the wrong declaration, restate syntax, or omit side effect/error/threshold/invariant language.
- **Complexity on rendering/parser code:** preserve public output/order compatibility unless extraction clearly lowers risk.
- **Global score still bad:** report global state plus targeted cluster delta; unrelated debt can remain.
- **Ignore seems broken:** config ignores apply during directory traversal; an explicit file path may still be analysed. Verify ignores with a directory scan or `check-ignore`.
- **`analyse` exits non-zero with no findings and mentions `schemaVersion`:** regenerate config with the installed tool's `init --force` flow, then reapply custom allowlists/severities. Do not hand-invent schema strings.
