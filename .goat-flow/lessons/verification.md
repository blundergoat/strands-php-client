## Lesson: Patch Repeated Assertions By Semantic Context

**Created:** 2026-05-24
**What happened:** While updating `Usage` tests for numeric-string parsing, repeated `$response->usage->outputTokens` assertions caused the wrong test expectations to be patched twice before the focused test run caught it.
**Evidence:** `tests/Unit/AgentResponseTest.php` (search: `testFromArrayHandlesNonIntUsageValues`) contains nearby repeated output-token assertions with different expected values.
**Prevention:** When changing repeated assertions, patch within the specific test method block or re-open the edited region before running tests. Do not rely on the first matching assertion text.
